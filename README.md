# Overview

I built this number guessing game in Java to sharpen my programming skills. As a software engineer, I wanted to get more comfortable with Javaâ€™s syntax, work with arrays and collections, and practice reading and writing files. The game itself picks a random number and gives you a few chances to guess it. Each guess is recorded, and in the end, your results are saved to a file so you can review your past attempts. My focus was on understanding the fundamentals of the language and the standard libraries, rather than adding lots of bells and whistles.

# Development Environment

I developed this game on a Windows machine using Visual Studio Code along with the Java Extension Pack. I used the standard JDK (no extra libraries) and ran the code with the built-in Java tools. This made the setup pretty straightforward, and I could easily test and run everything from the command line or within VSCode.

# Future Work

- **Better UI:** Maybe add a simple graphical interface to make the game more interactive.
- **Difficulty Settings:** Offer multiple difficulty levels or different ranges of numbers.
- **Advanced Scoring:** Add new scoring features, like tracking your best streak or showing leaderboards.
